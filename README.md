An open source dashboard project using Astro with API endpoints, Tailwind, and Supabase.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work-in-progress in very early stages and will definitely undergo significant changes. Please feel free to track the progress on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/theAlexWhitmore).

## Purpose

Astro has recently released 4.0 and is no longer just for content heavy websites (hasn't been for a while). I want to build out a "web-like" application using as many of the features as possible to see if I can find the limits of Astro. This project will remain open source and eventually be submitted as a [theme](https://astro.build/themes/) to Astro.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

```cli
git clone https://github.com/alexwhitmore/astro-dashboard.git my-project
```

2. Install dependencies:

```cli
npm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the variables:

```cli
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server:

```cli
npm run dev
```
